#NeuroRA

**A Python Toolbox of Representational Analysis from Multimodal Neural Data**

Overview
--------

**Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA)** has become a popular and effective method to measure the representation of multivariable neural activity in different modes.

**NeuroRA** is an easy-to-use toolbox based on **Python**, which can do some works about **RSA** among nearly all kinds of neural data, including **behavioral, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, sEEG, ECoG, fMRI and some other neuroelectrophysiological data**. In addition, users can do **Neural Pattern Similarity (NPS)**, **Spatiotemporal Pattern Similarity (STPS)**, **Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC)**, **Classification-based EEG Decoding** and **a novel cross-temporal RSA (CTRSA)** on **NeuroRA**.

Installation
------------

> pip install neurora
