Academic CV
===========

You can preview the CV as a PDF.

This repo contains Geoff Boeing's **LaTeX academic CV**, permissively licensed for others to adapt.

The CV content and formatting emphasize clear information presentation and typography. The CV's TeX file is _automatically compiled_ to PDF and published whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, via this workflow. This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file.
