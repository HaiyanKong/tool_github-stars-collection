Python for Psychologists
========================

This repo contains an introduction to Open and reproducible scientific programming for psychologists in Python. It stems from a series of seminars held at the University of Frankfurt, Department of Psychology. Materials include:

-   Class material: a series of notebooks, each corresponding to one in-class session, introducing material and providing exercises
    
-   Homework assignments: Students conducted experiments. The experimental programs themselves (in OpenSesame or Psychopy), the resulting data, and the analysis in the form of Jupyter Notebooks are presented.
    

Aim of the course
-----------------

-   learn to program for non-programmers (in particular, though not exclusively, experimental psychologists)
-   Open Science conforming scientific coding
    -   reproducible
    -   open for reuse
-   Contemporary coding practice conforming
    -   learning literate programming

How you can use this resource
-----------------------------

If you have not yet done so: Download and install Anaconda, a scientific Python distribution. Anaconda comes with many or most of the Python packages a researcher needs. It also comes with the Jupyter Notebook, a great starting point for learning and using Python for conducting research. Most of the resources here are Jupyter Notebooks, which you can download and run on your own computer.

For example, the folder ExampleAnalyses contains experiments conducted by students as final assignments of a Python for Psychologists class. The Notebooks (\*.ipynb files) containing the analyses -- for an example, check out this one -- of the results are complete, and fully reproducible. To reproduce one, download the notebook and the corresponding data files, store them in the correct file structure, for example, by downloading this entire repository, and open and run them in a Jupyter Notebook.
