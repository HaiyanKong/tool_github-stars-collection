This is the source code underlying the post Common statistical tests are linear models (or: how to teach stats). I explained it in this Twitter thread.

This is the main content:

-   **index.Rmd** is the Rmarkdown code which generated the post.
-   **linear\_tests\_cheat\_sheet.odt** is a Libreoffice Writer document with the cheat sheet.
-   **simulations** folder are the simulations of the accuracy of the parametric approximation to non-parametric tests.

Please contribute! For example:

-   Raise issues if you have ideas.
-   Submit pull requests if you want to participate improving it.
-   Star it if you just want to follow updates
-   Fork it to make your own spin!
