NIRS-KIT: A MATLAB toolbox for both task and resting-state fNIRS data analysis Images
=====================================================================================

\[Introduction:\]
-----------------

**NIRS-KIT is a MATLAB toolbox for both task and resting-state fNIRS data analysis with a user-friendly GUI. This toolbox covers the entire analysis pipeline, including data preparation, quality check, preprocessing, individual-level analysis, group-level statistics, and result visualization.**

**For task fNIRS data, individual-level analysis is carried out to detect task-related neural activation based on GLM. For resting-state fNIRS data, individual-level functional connectivity (FC), ALFF/fALFF, and network metrics can be calculated.**

**For group-level analysis, NIRS-KIT provides several popular parametric models and multiple comparison correction approaches. NIRS-KIT provides multiple visualization functions to visualize the statistical results.**

**Please contact houxin195776@mail.bnu.edu.cn or zhzong@mail.bnu.edu.cn for it. NIRS-ICA, a toolbox for removing fNIRS noise and extracting neural activity-related sources, has been integrated into NIRS-KIT. Please contact: zhaoyang@cibr.ac.cn for NIRS-ICA.**
